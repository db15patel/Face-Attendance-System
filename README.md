## Introduction üìù

This repository houses a web application developed to demonstrate the feasibility of automating attendance management using facial recognition technology. It offers administrators the ability to register new employees, upload their photos for training the model, and subsequently track attendance efficiently. The system enhances employee experience by allowing them to view their personal attendance records.

## Functionality Supported üöÄ

### Admin Panel üõ†Ô∏è

- **Admin and Employee Login:** Secure login for administrators and employees.
- **Register New Employees:** Admins can register new employees within the system.
- **Add Employee Photos:** Admins can upload employee photos to train the facial recognition model.
- **Train the Model:** Admins can train the model to recognize registered employees.
- **Attendance Reports:** Admins can access detailed attendance reports with filtering options.

### Employee Panel üë§

- **View Personal Attendance Reports:** Employees can view their own attendance records.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

The project leverages various technologies for accurate and efficient face recognition:

- **OpenCV:** Open-source computer vision and machine learning library.
- **Dlib:** C++ library containing machine learning algorithms.
- **face_recognition:** A library by Adam Geitgey for simplified face recognition.
- **Django:** Python framework for web development.
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for classification.

## Recognition Process üßê

1. **Face Detection:** Dlib's HOG facial detector identifies faces within images.
2. **Facial Landmark Detection:** Dlib's 68-point shape predictor enhances recognition accuracy.
3. **Extraction of Facial Embeddings:** The **face_recognition** library extracts unique facial embeddings.
4. **Classification of Unknown Embeddings:** Linear SVM classifies unknown embeddings for recognition.
